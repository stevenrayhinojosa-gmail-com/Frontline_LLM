Project: Frontline Education Chatbot
Objective:
Build an AI chatbot that assists educators in real-time as they navigate the Frontline Education SaaS platform. The chatbot will be trained exclusively on publicly available Frontline Education resources and will reject unrelated queries with a clever response.

Tech Stack:
FastAPI – For serving the chatbot API
ChromaDB – For storing and retrieving Frontline-related information
LangChain – For querying the database efficiently
OpenAI API (or Local Model) – For processing user queries
BeautifulSoup/Scrapy – For scraping Frontline’s public documentation
Replit & VS Code – For development and fine-tuning
Step 1: Data Collection & Storage
Scrape Frontline Education’s help center & documentation (or manually collect PDFs).
Preprocess & chunk data into smaller, retrievable sections.
Generate text embeddings using OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or a local embedding model.
Store embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.
Step 2: Chatbot Backend
Set up FastAPI on Replit for the chatbot’s API.
Integrate LangChain to retrieve relevant information from ChromaDB.
Filter non-Frontline queries and return a custom message like:
“I’m here to assist with Frontline Education! If you need help with something else, I recommend checking other resources.”
Deploy a test API endpoint for quick interaction.
Step 3: Testing & Refinement
Deploy on Replit and test responses.
Export to VS Code for optimizations.
Improve search relevance by fine-tuning embeddings and chunking methods.
Step 4: Presentation & Pitch
Create a GitHub repo with setup instructions.
Deploy a simple web demo (if possible) for testing.
Record a demo video showing how the chatbot assists users.
Pitch on LinkedIn, tagging key Frontline decision-makers.
